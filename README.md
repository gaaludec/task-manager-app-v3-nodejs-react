# Task Manager App V3

## Overview
**Task Manager App V3** is a simple, full-stack task management application. It enables users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. The app is built with **React** for the front-end and **Node.js with Express** for the back-end. The tasks are stored in a JSON file on the server.

---

## Features
- **Front-end**:
  - Display a list of tasks.
  - Add new tasks.
  - Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
  - Delete tasks.
  - Notifications for user actions using `react-toastify`.

- **Back-end**:
  - RESTful API to handle CRUD operations:
    - `GET /api/tasks`: Retrieve all tasks.
    - `POST /api/tasks`: Add a new task.
    - `PATCH /api/tasks/:id`: Update a task's status.
    - `DELETE /api/tasks/:id`: Remove a task.
  - File-based storage for tasks (`tasks.json`).
  - Middleware for CORS, JSON parsing, and logging in development mode (`morgan`).
